% "2D FDTD solution for open boundary in a spatial domain with
%                two different permittivities "
% 
% Objective of the program is to solve for the Maxwell's equation for a TM 
% wave containing the xy-plane polarized magnetic field having components Hy
% and Hx and z-polarized electric field Ez. The fields are updated at every 
% timestep, in a unitless space, where all physical parameters of free space 
% are normalized to 1. The update is done using standard update equations 
% obtained from the difference form of Maxwell's curl equations. The field 
% points are defined in a grid described by Yee's algorithm. The H fields are 
% defined at every half coordinate of spacesteps. More precisely, the Hx part
% is defined at every half y-coordinate and full x-coordinate and the Hy part
% is defined at every half x-coordinate and full y-coordinate and E fields 
% i.e the Ez part is defined at every full x and full y-coordinate points. 
% Also, the time update is done using Leapfrog time-stepping. Here, H-fields
% i.e Hx and Hy are updated every half time-step and E fields i.e Ez are 
% updated every full time-step. This is shown by three alternating for-loop 
% updates in groups of two (for H) and one (for E) spanning entire spatial 
% grid inside a main for-loop for time update spanning the entire time-grid.
%
% A source of electric field is defined at the center (vertical line) of the 
% spatial domain, which is hard , in that it does not change its value due to 
% interference from external fields i.e in other words, the source is a 
% perfect electric conductor. The form of the source can be varied using 
% the variables sine, gaussian and impulse. The source is available in four 
% standard forms- Gaussian and Sinusoidal forms. The permittivity on the two 
% sides of the vertical line source is different to show difference in
% traveling velocity and wavelength in the two materials.
%
% The color scaled plot of Ez field over the entire spatial domain is shown 
% at every time step. The simulation can be ended by closing this plot window 
% or by waiting till all the time step updates are completed.
